What was something amazing that happened to me today?
What was the best part of my day?
Who was the most interesting person I interacted with today?
What was the strongest emotion I felt today?
Who was my favorite person today?
If I had one thing I could do over today, what would it be?
How did I see the hand of the Lord in my life today?
What good thing did I do today that I could do even better tomorrow?
